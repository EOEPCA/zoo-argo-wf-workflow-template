# zoo-argo-wf-workflow-template

This repository contains a Helm chart to deploy an Argo Workflow WorkflowTemplate implementing an Application Package runner using Calrissian.

This WorkflowTemplate is deployed on a kubernetes cluster having Argo Workflows installed.

This WorkflowTemplate is an example of a "business logic" that Platform Operators customize for their own needs and requirements.

This WorkflowTemplate is used by Zoo's Argo Workflows runner (see https://github.com/EOEPCA/zoo-argowf-runner and https://github.com/EOEPCA/zoo-argo-wf-proc-service-template)
